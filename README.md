# Random-Number-sum

This is a simple Python script that generates 4 random numbers between 0 and 100, whose sum equals a number provided by the user.

### How it works
1. The user is prompted to input a number
2. A list called my_list is initialized empty
3. A function list() is defined to generate 4 random numbers between 0 and 100 and append them to my_list
4. A while loop continues generating new sets of 4 random numbers, summing them and checking if the sum equals the user's number
5. Once the sum of the 4 random numbers equals the user's number, the loop breaks
6. The final set of 4 random numbers that sum to the user's number is printed
### Usage
To use this script:
1. Run the Python file **random_sum.py**
2. When prompted, input an integer
3. The script will print 4 random numbers whose sum equals your number
